# Multi Digit Neural Network Classifier

COMP 551: Applied machine learning project 3.

This project implements a VGG deep learning neural network to classify multiple modified MNIST digits. The model achieved 100% validation and training accuracy after about 40 epochs, and reached 99.785% accuracy on the Kaggle test set - which is good for 6th place / 98.

Project done with Sofia Dieguez and Diana Sera.
